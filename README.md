# Denomination App

## Description

This project allows the calculation of denominations required to reach given amount.

## Usage

First, choose how you wish the calculation to be performed, either by frontend or backend. <br>
This option was included to demonstrate two development approaches.

Second, enter an amount in Euros and click "Submit". <br>
The result will show up under "New Value". <br>
If another input is given, the previous amount will shop up under "Old value", <br>
and a difference table will showcase the difference in denomination between the 2 inputs.
